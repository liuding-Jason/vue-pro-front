## Vue-router 

Vue-router is the vue router defination plugin . It has two types of mode , hash mode and history mode . In this project , we would use history mode . And every router item would be defined with `require` to run async task , like below :
```
{
    path : "/testA" ,
    meta : {
        title : 'testA'
    } ,
    component : (resolve) => require(['./views/testA.vue'] , resolve)
} 
```
## Vuex 

Vuex is the vue state manage plugin , which has `state` 、`getters` 、'mutations' 、'actions' 、'modules' attributes . It would make it easy to communicate between two son components , or between son and grandparent components .

In this project , we would use many modules to manage different states . That is to say , you should use a new module defination with your new logic codes . I offer you simple and complex defination example in store contect . 

## Iview2.0

Iview2.0 is a component library based on vue2.0 . It actually contains almost every component which you could use in your web project . So we decide to use iview2.0 to be our component library .
